## My process

- I started of planning the layout and what HTML tags I will use for each and the classes / ids.
- Then I built out my index.html file.
- Did a reset on my CSS file to remove paddings, margins and to set box-sizing.
- Created my CSS variables.
- Then styled the layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- I was able to fully understand how to use media queries.
- It was my first time using custom CSS variables.

Some CSS code I'm proud of

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 375px) {
	.qr-code-card {
		width: 300px;
	}
}
```

### Continued development

- I want to do more projects with media queries.
